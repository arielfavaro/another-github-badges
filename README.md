# Another Github Badges
**GitHub Badges for your README.md profile and projects, like visits counter.**

This version is based on **repository id**, so it's safe to rename your repository and change the badge URL. This will keep the stats intact.

There is no way to count unique visitors, because GitHub proxies all images URLs through [GitHub Camo](https://github.blog/2010-11-13-sidejack-prevention-phase-3-ssl-proxied-assets/)

## Available Badges ðŸŽŸ
**Add to your README.md via markdown syntax:**

### Visits Counter
